# FootBot
We'll use OpenCV/RaspberryPi2/arduino to make a soccer robot

You can find the avancement of my prject with "dossier technique"
it's only in french for the moment but I'll translate it later
The goal is to build a robot who are able to find the ball, pick it up, find the goal and shoot.
Later I want to made 1 or 2 other robots and made them played together

I want to separate my project on diffrents steps :
1-traking color with my computer's webcam
2-add 2servo and put my camera on it to follow a object which are moving
3-put it on my Raspberry and on a mobile platforme
